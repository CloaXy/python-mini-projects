# Encrypt_it
The written program takes user input, a distance value for the encryption and encrypts the message that was given by the user.
With this code, a privacy problem is solved. It is a simple program that encrypts a message given by the user, by using a distance value that will move the character's value on the ascii-table. A decryption program can also then be written to decrypt a given message using that same distance value the first user used.
